# @posthog/brand

PostHog's brand assets, as an npm package: hedgehog illustrations, logos, crests, and
brand colors — React components, raw SVGs, PNG URLs, and color tokens, all bundled into the
package, so there are **zero runtime CDN calls**.

```bash
pnpm add @posthog/brand
```

## Quick start

The primary surface is **React components** — one per asset, imported from a namespace
subpath. Each is an inline-SVG component, so it scales crisply and tree-shakes down to only
what you import.

```tsx
import { HedgehogDoctorHog } from "@posthog/brand/hoggies"
import { Logo } from "@posthog/brand/logo"
import { ArrayCrest } from "@posthog/brand/crests"

export function Example() {
  return (
    <>
      <HedgehogDoctorHog size={120} title="A hedgehog doctor" />
      <Logo size={200} title="PostHog" />
      <ArrayCrest size={64} /> {/* full crest */}
      <ArrayCrest.Mini size={24} /> {/* simplified mini badge */}
    </>
  )
}
```

Naming follows the namespace: hoggies are `Hedgehog<Name>`. Crests are a compound component
`<Name>Crest` whose base is the full illustration and whose `.Mini` is the simplified badge.

The logo is a single generic `<Logo>` component (see [Logo](#logo) below).

### Props

Components accept all native `<svg>` props, plus:

- **`size`** — sets the width (number = px, or any CSS length); height follows the
  illustration's aspect ratio.
- **`title`** — an accessible label. When set, the image is announced (via an SVG
  `<title>`); when omitted, it's treated as decorative (`aria-hidden`).

Each illustration component also carries its metadata as a static `.meta`
(`HedgehogDoctorHog.meta.slug`, `.aspectRatio`, …).

## Logo

The logo isn't a per-asset namespace — it's one generic, parametric component that covers
every lockup and color treatment, so it can be the single PostHog logo you use everywhere.

```tsx
import { Logo } from "@posthog/brand/logo"
;<Logo /> // landscape lockup, full gradient (the defaults)
;<Logo variant="mono" color="#fff" /> // single color
;<Logo variant="mono" /> // inherits the ambient CSS `color`
;<Logo variant="print" layout="stacked" /> // 4-color / CMYK, portrait lockup
;<Logo.Logomark /> // the hedgehog icon only
;<Logo.Wordmark /> // the "PostHog" wordmark only
```

| Prop      | Values                                                    | Default        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `variant` | `"gradient"` · `"print"` (4-color/CMYK) · `"mono"`        | `"gradient"`   |
| `layout`  | `"landscape"` · `"stacked"` · `"logomark"` · `"wordmark"` | `"landscape"`  |
| `color`   | any CSS color — used by `mono` only                       | `currentColor` |

`Logo.Logomark` and `Logo.Wordmark` are shorthands for `layout="logomark"` / `"wordmark"`.
A `mono` logo (and the always-mono wordmark) draws with `currentColor`, so it inherits the
surrounding text color unless you pass an explicit `color`. Every form also accepts `size`,
`title`, `className`, `style`, and the rest of the native `<svg>` props.

## Namespaces

Assets are grouped into namespaces, each its own set of subpath exports. The component import
is the one you'll reach for most; every namespace also exposes raw SVG strings, PNG URLs, and
metadata (see the collapsed sections below).

| Namespace | Component import         | Naming                  |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `hoggies` | `@posthog/brand/hoggies` | `Hedgehog<Name>`        |
| `crests`  | `@posthog/brand/crests`  | `<Name>Crest` + `.Mini` |

(The logo lives at `@posthog/brand/logo` but is a single `<Logo>` component, not a per-asset
namespace — see [Logo](#logo).)

Crests come in two size tiers — the full illustration and the simplified `mini` badge. The
combined `@posthog/brand/crests` barrel pairs them as `<Name>Crest` + `.Mini`. If you want a
single tier on its own, the tier-specific subpaths expose each one individually:
`ArrayCrest` from `@posthog/brand/crests/full`, `ArrayCrestMini` from
`@posthog/brand/crests/mini`.

The root `@posthog/brand` is **metadata-only** (types + the cross-namespace manifest +
search) — it pulls in no React and no image payload.

## Raw SVGs and PNGs

Sometimes you don't want a React component — you need the raw SVG markup (to inline into an
email or a non-React app) or a bundled PNG URL (for an `<img>` tag). Every asset ships as
**both** an optimized inline SVG (minified with SVGO) and an optimized PNG (palette-quantized
with pngquant, then losslessly recompressed with oxipng — still a standard PNG, so it renders
anywhere).

```ts
import doctorHogSvg from "@posthog/brand/hoggies/svg/doctor-hog" // SVG string
import doctorHogPng from "@posthog/brand/hoggies/png/doctor-hog" // bundled PNG URL
```

<details>
<summary><strong>All <code>/svg</code> and <code>/png</code> subpaths</strong></summary>

Each namespace exposes the same four shapes. Replace `<g>` with one of `hoggies`,
`crests/full`, or `crests/mini` (the combined `crests` barrel is React-only — use the tier
subpaths for raw SVG/PNG; the logo ships only the `<Logo>` component):

| Subpath                         | Returns                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>`            | React components                                     |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>/svg`        | barrel of named SVG strings (`hedgehogDoctorHogSvg`) |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>/svg/<slug>` | a single SVG string as the default export            |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>/png`        | barrel of named PNG URLs (`hedgehogDoctorHogPng`)    |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>/png/<slug>` | a single PNG URL as the default export               |
| `@posthog/brand/<g>/metadata`   | the group's `AssetMeta[]` manifest (React-free)      |

```ts
// Default import of the deep path — one asset, one module:
import doctorHogSvg from "@posthog/brand/hoggies/svg/doctor-hog"
import arrayCrestPng from "@posthog/brand/crests/full/png/array"

// Or the named barrel export, if you'd rather pull several from one import:
import { hedgehogDoctorHogSvg, hedgehogCakeHogSvg } from "@posthog/brand/hoggies/svg"

// Lazy-load by slug without bundling the whole namespace:
const svg = (await import("@posthog/brand/hoggies/svg/" + slug)).default
```

Crest minis keep a trailing `Mini` in their identifiers: `arrayCrestMiniSvg`,
`arrayCrestMiniPng`.

</details>

## Colors

```ts
import { colors } from "@posthog/brand/colors"

colors.blue.core // "#1490E8"
colors["corn-blue"].gradient // ["#2BB3DF", "#1A89AD"]
```

Each color has `core`, `lighter`, `darker`, and a `gradient` pair.

<details>
<summary><strong>Ready-made CSS custom properties</strong></summary>

For stylesheets, import the generated CSS custom properties instead of the JS object:

```ts
import { colorsCss } from "@posthog/brand/colors/css"
// :root { --posthog-blue: #1490E8; --posthog-blue-lighter: …; --posthog-blue-gradient: …; }
```

</details>

## Metadata and search

The root export is React-free and carries the full cross-namespace manifest plus helpers for
building a picker or looking an asset up by slug:

```ts
import { allAssets, findAssets, getAsset, getComponentName } from "@posthog/brand"

findAssets({ namespace: "crests", tier: "mini", text: "array" })
findAssets({ namespace: "hoggies", text: "doctor" })
getAsset("hoggies", "doctor-hog") // full AssetMeta
getAsset("crests", "array", "mini") // disambiguate the shared crest slug by tier
getComponentName("hoggies", "doctor-hog") // "HedgehogDoctorHog"
getComponentName("crests", "array", "mini") // "ArrayCrestMini"
```

Per-namespace manifests are also available without the cross-namespace pull — e.g.
`@posthog/brand/hoggies/metadata`.

## How assets get here

Brand assets live in PostHog's [brand-book Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/EqKxlSFoOCkRXCnHi4C3eE).
A daily GitHub Action renders every component to SVG + PNG via the Figma API, syncs the
result into this repo (`assets/`), and commits the changes — plus a
[changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) — straight to `main` (no PR). That
triggers the release workflow, which bumps the version, commits it back to `main`, and
publishes to npm with trusted publishing (OIDC) — gated behind Slack approval, per the
[PostHog SDK release process](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/sdks/releases).

The color palette is not synced — it's a fixed, hand-maintained list in
[`static/colors.ts`](./static/colors.ts). Edit it there (with a changeset) to change the
published tokens. The `<Logo>` component is likewise hand-maintained: its geometry is inlined
in [`src/logo/`](./src/logo) (not Figma-synced), since the logo is small and rarely changes.

The sync is incremental and batched: it re-renders only assets whose Figma node changed, so a
typical run stays well under Figma's per-minute API limit (it requires a Dev/Full-seat token).

Both formats are optimized before they're committed, so every asset stays small without
losing browser compatibility:

- **SVG** is minified with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) (`scripts/lib/svg.ts`) — its
  browser-safe `preset-default`, with each asset's ids namespaced so inlined SVGs never
  collide on the same page.
- **PNG** is shrunk by [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) (palette quantization) and then
  losslessly recompressed with [oxipng](https://github.com/oxipng/oxipng)
  (`scripts/lib/png.ts`). The output is still a standard PNG — it renders in any browser —
  just ~70% smaller. The pass never grows a file, so it's safe to re-run.

## Demo site

A live showcase of everything in this package lives in [`site/`](./site) — a Vite + React app
that imports `@posthog/brand` as a workspace dependency, so it renders the **real built
components**, not copies. It has pages for the logo, colors, hoggies, and crests, and is meant to
grow into the home for [PostHog's brand assets](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/brand-assets).

```bash
pnpm dev:site     # builds the package, then starts the site dev server
pnpm build:site   # builds the package, then the static site into site/dist
```

It deploys to Cloudflare Pages via the dashboard's Git integration
