# @posthog/hedgehogs

PostHog's hedgehog illustrations, as an npm package. React components, raw SVGs, and
searchable metadata — all bundled into the package, so there are **zero runtime CDN calls**.

```bash
pnpm add @posthog/hedgehogs
```

```tsx
import { HedgehogDoctorNurse } from "@posthog/hedgehogs";

export function Example() {
  return <HedgehogDoctorNurse size={120} title="A hedgehog doctor" />;
}
```

Every component is named `Hedgehog<Name>` (so your editor autocompletes the whole set
when you type `Hedgehog`), carries its metadata as a static `.meta`, and is fully
tree-shakeable — importing one hedgehog bundles only that one.

## Entry points

| Import                        | What you get                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@posthog/hedgehogs`          | Smart React component per hedgehog (inline SVG when available, else PNG) |
| `@posthog/hedgehogs/svg`      | Raw SVG strings + lazy loader (only assets shipped as SVG)               |
| `@posthog/hedgehogs/png`      | Bundled PNG URLs + lazy loader (every asset)                             |
| `@posthog/hedgehogs/metadata` | Tiny manifest + search helpers, no image payload — build pickers here    |

## Props

Components accept all native `<svg>` / `<img>` props, plus:

- `size` — sets the width (number = px, or any CSS length); height follows the
  illustration's aspect ratio.
- `title` — an accessible label. When set the image is announced (SVG `<title>` /
  `<img alt>`); when omitted it's treated as decorative (`aria-hidden`).

```tsx
import { HedgehogWizard } from "@posthog/hedgehogs";

<HedgehogWizard size={200} title="A wizard hedgehog" className="float-right" />;
```

## Raw SVGs and PNGs

```ts
import doctorNurse from "@posthog/hedgehogs/svg/doctor-nurse"; // SVG string
import wizardPng from "@posthog/hedgehogs/png/wizard"; // bundled PNG URL
```

Both subpaths also expose named exports (`hedgehogDoctorNurseSvg`, `hedgehogWizardPng`)
and lazy loaders (`loadHedgehogSvg(slug)`, `loadHedgehogPng(slug)`) for building pickers
without bundling every asset.

## Metadata and search

```ts
import { findHedgehogs, getHedgehog, hedgehogs, tagVocabulary } from "@posthog/hedgehogs/metadata";

findHedgehogs({ tags: ["wizard"], version: "v3" });
findHedgehogs({ text: "coffee", delivery: "svg" });
getHedgehog("doctor-nurse"); // full HedgehogMeta
```

`getRasterUrl(slug, "lg" | "original")` returns higher-resolution CDN URLs when you need
more than the bundled 768px PNG — note that those _do_ hit the network.

## SVG vs PNG delivery

Most illustrations are auto-traced vectors that are multiple megabytes each, so bundling
every SVG isn't viable. Each asset therefore ships in the best form that fits the budget:

- `delivery: "svg"` — a true vector, optimized and inlined (crisp, scalable).
- `delivery: "png"` — a 768px PNG rendered from the same source (the trace came _from_ that raster, so fidelity matches).

Either way the API is identical and everything is bundled — no runtime CDN calls. Filter
by `delivery` in `findHedgehogs`, or read `Component.meta.delivery`. We're steadily
migrating assets toward `"svg"`.

> All assets are included regardless of `usageType`. For external surfaces, filter
> `findHedgehogs({ usageType: "public" })`.

## How art gets here

Illustrations live in PostHog's art pipeline and are published to a public catalog.
A daily GitHub Action syncs that catalog into this repo (`assets/`) and commits the
changes — plus a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) — straight to
`main` (no PR). That triggers the release workflow, which bumps the version, commits it
back to `main`, and publishes to npm with trusted publishing (OIDC) — gated behind Slack
approval, per the
[PostHog SDK release process](https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/sdks/releases).

Every asset ships as an optimized SVG when it's a true vector under budget, otherwise as a
768px PNG rendered from the same source. We're migrating everything toward true SVGs, and a
weekly Slack report tracks progress.
